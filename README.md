# LinkedIn Automation Tool

This is a LinkedIn automation tool built using **Python** and **Selenium**. It automates the process of engaging with posts on LinkedIn by:

- Liking posts with an appropriate reaction based on the post's text.

## Features

### Implemented Features
- **Login Automation**: Automatically logs into your LinkedIn account.
- **Post Engagement**: 
  - Selects posts from your feed.
  - If a post has fewer than 50 likes, it selects a random reaction and likes the post.
  - If a post has more than 50 likes, it has a 1% chance of liking the post; otherwise, the post is ignored.

### Planned Features
- **Commenting on Posts**: Automatically writes comments based on the post's text.
- **Local LLM Integration**: The tool will use a local Language Model (LLM) server that you can set up yourself.
- **Smart Post Selection**: Skips controversial posts based on LLM evaluation of the post's content.
